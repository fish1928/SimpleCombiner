1. SimpleCombiner.permutate is just a simple permutation function.
2. SimpleCombiner.combine is a little bit different from normal combination. The main difference is like this case:
  2.1 we want no duplication combination of any element in ['a','b'], and we want 3 elements in all.
  2.2 then we could use SimpleCombiner.combine(['a','b'], 3)
  2.3 print it and you will know what i mean
3. You could use these two method to generate test conditions.
